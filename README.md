# Dijkstras-Algorithm
Finding the shortest path from source to destination using Dijkstra's Algorithm. In this C++ Standard Template Library is used to implement several data structures which help in doing the task.

The input to this program should be given as specified in the below link(Infact this program is the solution to that question)

This program has all the details on:
-how to build a graph in C++
-how to use several data structures such as queue(priority_queue), map, vectors and list.
-Finally perfrom the task of finding the shortest path using dijkstras algorithm in C++
